                        When Naganuma's singer-songwriter career did not work, in 1998 he sent demo tapes of his music to Sega. His first job for Sega was voice
                        editing for Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Itsuka Kakumei Sareru Monogatari and then first composition was for Hip Jog Jog.
